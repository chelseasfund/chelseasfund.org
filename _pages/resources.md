This page provides links to other abortion and health resources, as
well as highlighting various news and journalism covering the topic of
abortion. [Chelsea's Fund](/) is not generally affiliated with the
resources on this page, but provides them as potentially useful to
other Wyoming residents.

## Abortion and Health Resources

### Wyoming Abortion Fund

Like Chelsea's Fund, the [Wyoming Abortion
Fund](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-rocky-mountains/patient-resources/wyoming-abortion-fund)
assists Wyoming residents in funding abortions. If you live in Wyoming
and need help paying for an abortion, the Wyoming Abortion Fund may be
able to help you. Call their toll-free hotline, **(866) 372-7526**, to
see if you qualify. Although this fund is administered by Planned
Parenthood, you can choose any abortion provider; it does not have to
be a Planned Parenthood health center.

### Exhale

[Exhale](https://exhaleprovoice.org/) provides after-abortion support
via a talk-line at **866-4-EXHALE**. They aim to create a social
climate where each person’s unique experience with abortion is
supported, respected, and free from stigma. Exhale provides services,
training, and education to empower individuals, families, and
communities to achieve post-abortion health and well-being.

### NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Wyoming

[NARAL Pro-Choice America](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/) was
established in 1969 as the National Association for the Repeal of
Abortion Laws. After the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision,
NARAL changed its name to the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League and subsequently to NARAL Pro-Choice
America. NARAL works to protect and expand reproductive freedom across
the United States through lobbying and using the political process to
advance good ideas to protect individual freedom and fight back
against ideas that threaten individual privacy.

NARAL's Wyoming affiliate is [NARAL Pro-Choice
Wyoming](https://www.prochoicewyoming.org/). NARAL Pro-Choice Wyoming
provides critical watch-dogging and lobbying in Wyoming's legislature
and throughout the state. **If you want to stay informed on pending
issues or support pro-choice lobbying in Wyoming**, please consider
becoming a member of NARAL Pro-choice Wyoming.

### National Network of Abortion Funds

The [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/)
(NNAF) is the "hub" of individual abortion funds such as Chelsea's
Fund, creating opportunities for funds to share their work, to learn
from each other, and to support each other, wherever they were
located. NNAF includes nearly 100 abortion funds in the United States,
Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The Network also includes one
international Internet-based abortion fund that helps individuals who
live in countries where access to abortion care is severely limited or
illegal. NNAF educates legislators, the White House, the national
media, and the public about the particular barriers to abortion for
low-income individuals, immigrants, Native and indigenous people,
minors, individuals in prison, and rural and urban individuals.  They
work at the national level to fight against unjust policies like the
Hyde Amendment that interfere with low-income individuals' access to
abortion care. **Chelsea's Fund is a proud NNAF affiliate.**

### Planned Parenthood

For nearly 100 years, [Planned
Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) has promoted a
commonsense approach to reproductive health and well-being, based on
respect for each individual’s right to make informed, independent
decisions about health, sex, and family planning. Planned Parenthood
is dedicated to offering adults and teens high-quality, affordable
medical care. The nearest abortion clinic for many Wyoming residents
is a Planned Parenthood clinic.

### Guttmacher Institute

The [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/) advances
sexual and reproductive health and rights through an interrelated
program of research, policy analysis and public education designed to
generate new ideas, encourage enlightened public debate and promote
sound policy and program development. The Institute’s overarching goal
is to ensure the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health
for all people worldwide.

### Our Bodies Ourselves

[Our Bodies Ourselves](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/) (OBOS) is
a nonprofit, public interest organization based in Cambridge, MA, that
develops and promotes evidence-based information on girls' and women's
reproductive health and sexuality. They publish the well-known
[women's health
manual](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/publications/our-bodies-ourselves-2011/)
of the same name.

### RAINN

[RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/) is a national nonprofit organization
dedicated to preventing sexual assault, assisting survivors, and
ensuring perpetrators are brought to justice. They operate the
**National Sexual Assault Hotline** (available 24/7) where victims of
sexual assault can receive free, confidential support and
counseling. The hotline can be reached:

* Via phone at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)
