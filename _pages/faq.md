This page answers questions frequently asked of [Chelsea's Fund](/)
regarding both abortion and [the organization itself](/about).

## How common is abortion?

Abortion is common. One in four women in the US has an abortion [by
the age of
45](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states). People
have abortions for many valid reasons, including their health, their
finances, their age, their career goals, their family situation, and
other reasons.

## Where can I get an abortion?

Please see our [Abortion Providers](/providers) page to locate the
nearest provider to you. As this site is intended for Wyoming
residents, we list abortion providers in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana,
Utah, and Idaho that are most relevant to Wyoming residents.

## What if I cannot afford an abortion?

Chelsea's Fund will work with you to help find funding for your
abortion. In addition to our fund, we can direct you to other
funding sources and suggest additional ways to pay for your
abortion. Please see our [Financial Assistance](/financial) page for
more information.

## Must I be a US citizen to receive assistance?

No. We do not ask about your country of citizenship or immigration status. 
Anyone who lives in Wyoming is eligible for [financial assistance](/financial). 
You may also be eligible if you live in eastern Idaho and are going to one of
the two [Jackson, WY clinics](/providers/#wyoming).

## Can I receive funds if I don’t live in Wyoming?

Unfortunately, no, unless you live in eastern Idaho and are seeking
services in [Jackson, WY](/providers/#wyoming). If you live elsewhere,
please contact the [National Network of Abortion
Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/) for funding suggestions.

## Where does Chelsea's Fund get its funding?

Chelsea's Fund is funded by generous private donors who believe
everyone has a right to personal reproductive decisions and no one
should be denied an abortion due to financial barriers.

## How can I donate to Chelsea's Fund?

You may [donate online](https://form-renderer-app.donorperfect.io/give/chelseas-fund/online-donation-form-w-paypal) or
you can mail your donation to Chelsea's Fund, PO Box 1472,
Lander, WY 82520. See our [About Us](/about/#donations) page for more
information. Thank you for your support!

## How will my donation be used?

Chelsea's Fund is primarly staffed by volunteers. That means the bulk
of your donated funds go entirely to help people pay for the cost of
the abortion. At this time, we are also using donations to support out
[ongoing litigation](/litigation) to keep Abortion legal in
Wyoming. See our [About Us](/about) page for more information.

## Where can I get affordable birth control?

If you have health insurance, ask your insurer about coverage. All
Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) compliant plans must cover
contraceptive methods and counseling. These plans must
cover [birth control
services](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control)
without charging a co-payment or co-insurance when they’re provided by
an in-network provider. This is true even if you haven’t met your
deductible. See
[HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/)
for more info.

If you don't have insurance, find your nearest [Wyoming Title X
clinic](http://www.wyhc.org/wyoming-clinics/). These clinics provide
affordable birth control options on a sliding scale based on your
income. They will not deny anyone services because they are unable to
pay. Teenagers do not need parental permission to receive birth control
services.
