This page answers questions frequently asked of [Women for Women](/)
regarding both [abortion](/abortion) and [the organization
itself](/about).

## How common is abortion?

Abortion is common. One in four women in the US has an abortion [by
the age of
45](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states). Women
have abortions for many valid reasons including their health, their
finances, their age, their career goals, their family situation, and
numerous more. Please see our [About Abortion](/abortion) page for
more information.

## Where can I get an abortion?

Please see our [Abortion Providers](/providers) page to locate the
nearest provider to you. As this site is intended for Wyoming
residents, we list abortion providers in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana,
Utah, and Idaho that are most relevant to Wyoming residents.

## What if I cannot afford an abortion?

[Women for Women](/) will work with you to help find funding for your
abortion. In addition to our funds, we can direct you to additional
funding sources and counsel you on additional ways to pay for your
abortion. Please see our [Financial Assistance](/financial) page for
more information.

## Must I be a US citizen to receive assistance?

No. We do not ask about your country of citizenship. In order to
receive financial assistance from Women for Women, you must only be a
resident of Wyoming, or live in the Victor/Driggs area of Idaho.

## Can I receive funds if I don’t live in Wyoming?

Unfortunately, no, unless you live in the Victor/Driggs are of Idaho
and are seeking services in Jackson, WY. If you are not a Wyoming
resident, please contact the [National Network of Abortion
Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/) for funding suggestions.

## Where does Women for Women get its funding?

Women for Women is funded by generous private donors who believe
everyone has a right to personal reproductive decisions and no one
should be denied an abortion due to financial barriers.

## How can I donate to Women for Women?

You may donate online via [our Paypal account](/about/#donations) or
you can mail your donation to Women for Women, PO Box 1472,
Lander, WY 82520. See our [About Us](/about/#donations) page for more
information. Thanks for asking!

## How will my donation be used?

Women for Women is all-volunteer. That means all donated funds,
excepting negligible amounts for stamps, P.O. Box fees, etc., go
entirely to help women pay for the cost of the abortion. See our
[About Us](/about) page for more information.

## Where can I get affordable birth control?

If you have health insurance, ask your insurer about coverage. All
Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) compliant plans must cover
contraceptive methods and counseling for all women. These plans must
cover [birth control
services](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control)
without charging a co-payment or co-insurance when they’re provided by
an in-network provider. This is true even if you haven’t met your
deductible. See
[HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/)
for more info.

If you don't have insurance, find your nearest [Wyoming Title X
clinic](http://www.wyhc.org/wyoming-clinics/). THese clinics provide
affordable birth control options on a sliding scale based on your
income. They will not deny anyone services because they are unable to
pay. Teenagers do not need parental permission to receive birth control
services.
