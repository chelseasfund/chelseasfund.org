During the fall of 2020 and in response to a 40-day anti-choice action
in Lander, WY, Chelsea's Fund raised dedicated funding to post a
billboard in downtown Lander in support of the right to choose. The
billboard quotes Justice Ginsburg:

      woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself."

We continued our advocacy efforts in 2021 by adding a billboard in Riverton, WY as well.

We hope these messages help our Wyoming community know that we are
here and [available to help](/financial). Across the country funds
like ours are choosing to become more visible and more vocal as we
recognize the need to speak openly about reproductive healthcare.
