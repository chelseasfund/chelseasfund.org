During the fall of 2020 and in response to a 40-day anti-choice action
in Lander, WY, Chelsea's Fund separately fundraised to post a
billboard in downtown Lander in support of the right to choose. The
billboard quotes Justice Ginsburg:

    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/billboard.jpg">
       <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/billboard.jpg" class="full">
    </a>

      Billboard with the RBG quote, "The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a
      woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself."

We hope this billboard helps our Wyoming community know that we are
here and [available to help](/financial). Across the country funds
like ours are choosing to become more visible and more vocal as we
recognize the need to speak openly about reproductive healthcare.
