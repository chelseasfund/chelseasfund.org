title: "Abortion's Legality in Wyoming"
---

**We are currently litigating the legality of abortion in Wyoming.**

After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June of
2022, Chelsea's Fund has been involved in litigation to uphold the
right to an abortion in Wyoming. In July of 2022, we [filed
suit](/assets/files/2022-07-25_complaint.pdf) to stop the Wyoming
abortion ban from taking effect on July 27th. In response the District
Court has granted a [preliminary
injunction](/assets/files/2022-08-10_injunction.pdf) blocking
Wyoming's abortion ban from going into effect until they can hear the
case. In November of 2022, the District Court [referred the case]() to
the Wyoming Supreme Court for decision. In December of 2022, the
Wyoming Supreme Court [declined to
hear](/assets/files/2022-12-20_decline.pdf) the case.

In March of 2023, the Wyoming legislature passed a new statewide
abortion ban that repeals and replaces the ban our existing lawsuit
contested. Governor Gordon allowed this new ban to pass into law in
March 18th, 2023. This action again rendered abortion illegal in
Wyoming. In response, we filed a [new
lawsuit](/assets/files/2023-03-21_complaint.pdf) seeking to overturn
this ban, as well as [a request](/assets/files/2023-03-17_motion.pdf)
for a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking the ban until a court
can rule on our case. On March 22nd, 2023, our TRO request was
granted, allowing abortion to remain legal in Wyoming until the court
can hear our case. We are awaiting the District Court's next steps in
the case.
