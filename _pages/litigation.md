title: "Abortion's Legality in Wyoming"
---

**Abortion remains legal in Wyoming at this time.**

After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June of
2022, Chelsea's Fund has been involved in litigation to uphold the
right to an abortion in Wyoming. In July of 2022, we [filed
suit](/assets/files/2022-07-25_complaint.pdf) to stop the Wyoming
abortion ban from taking effect on July 27th. In response the District
Court has granted a [preliminary
injunction](/assets/files/2022-08-10_injunction.pdf) blocking
Wyoming's abortion ban from going into effect until they can hear the
case. In November of 2022, the District Court [referred the case]() to
the Wyoming Supreme Court for decision. In December of 2022, the
Wyoming Supreme Court [declined to
hear](/assets/files/2022-12-20_decline.pdf) the case. We are awaiting
the District Court's next steps in the case.
