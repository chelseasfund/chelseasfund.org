## A Note on Parental Consent

If you are under 18, a parent or guardian may need to be notified of
your intent to receive an abortion and provide consent. Parental
consent is NOT required under Montana law, but is required in Wyoming,
Colorado, and Utah. To find out more about the specific requirements of
the state where you will have the abortion and the judicial bypass
option, contact the clinic where you plan to get your abortion.
