## General Information

Providers generally provide one or both the the following
[abortion](/abortion) methods:

* **Medical Abortion (a.k.a. The Abortion Pill):** This method of abortion
    uses a [course of
    medication](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill)
    to end a pregnancy. It is generally available during the first 10
    weeks pregnancy (up to 10 weeks after the first day of your
    last period).
* **Surgical Abortion:** This method of abortion involves a doctor
    [surgically ending](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures)
    a pregnancy. It is generally available through the second
    trimester of pregnancy (up to 21 weeks after the first day of your
    last period).

Abortion costs vary by provider and length of pregnancy. In general,
later term abortions are more expensive than earlier term abortions,
and surgical abortions are more expensive than medical
abortions. Abortions involving IV sedation (some surgical procedures)
or for women who are [Rh
negative](https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/The-Rh-Factor-How-It-Can-Affect-Your-Pregnancy)
may incur additional charges. **[Women for Women](/) can provide
[financial assistance](/financial) to those who require it.**

**If you are a minor**, a parent or guardian may need to be notified
of your intent to receive an abortion and provide consent. Parental
consent is currently required in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, and
Utah. To find out more about the specific requirements of the state
where you will have the abortion and judicial bypass options, contact
the clinic where you plan to get your abortion.
