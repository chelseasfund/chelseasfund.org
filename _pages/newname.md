We are pleased to share with you that Women for Women’s name has
[officially changed](/assets/files/irs_501c3.pdf) to Chelsea’s
Fund. Careful consideration, broad input, and quite some time went
into this decision. While we definitely have historical and emotional
attachments to the original name chosen by our founder Chelsea
Kesselheim, we believe that this name change better reflects our
mission as we move forward. Our key considerations in reaching this
decision included:

* We recognize reproductive healthcare as an issue that impacts all
people and all families. We want our name to be inclusive,
acknowledging that people of all gender identities both support us and
may be directly served by us.
* We wish to avoid confusion with the similarly named organization,
[Women for Women International](https://www.womenforwomen.org/).
* In selecting our new name we chose to honor Chelsea, our founder,
and to use her name as a reminder of the spirit, determination, and
passion for a more just world that mobilized Chelsea and so many
others who have gone before us.

We are revising our informational materials and website to reflect
this change. Our mission and vision remain the same, as do our address
and phone number. Donations may continue to be made as described on
[this website](/about/#donations). We celebrate the positive change
we have been able to make in many lives through your continued support
and the dedicated work of all those who volunteer their time, energy
and expertise to help Wyoming residents access the abortion care they
need. We are tremendously grateful for the role each of you plays in
this group endeavor. As always we welcome your input and inquiries.
