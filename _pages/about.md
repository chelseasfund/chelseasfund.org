Chelsea's Fund was established in 1998 and has been supporting Wyoming
residents ever since. [Prior to 2019](/newname/), we were known as
Women for Women.

## Overview

[Chelsea's Fund](/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established
to ensure Wyoming people can make and implement the critical personal
decision whether to terminate a pregnancy. Currently, Wyoming
residents must travel out of state or to the far western corner of
Wyoming to access an abortion provider. Consequently, in addition to
the procedureâ€™s cost, they often incur substantial expenses for travel
and time away from responsibilities. Many cannot come up with those
funds in the short time before the procedure. One in four women in the
US has an abortion [by the age of
45](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states).
Having an abortion is something many people decide is necessary and
critical to their lives. Pregnant people are the best at making that
decision for themselves.

## Mission

We firmly believe that a person's ability to make and implement these
critical decisions about their own body, their own life, and their
physical, emotional and financial health should not depend on whether
they have the financial resources to instantly pay this unexpected and
significant expense. Having sufficient funds should not be the
determining factor for whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Chelsea's
Fund is here to help bring reproductive justice to Wyoming residents
and to make sure that children are wanted, intentional, and not a
result of lacking sufficient money.

## Donations

Chelsea's Fund is run primarily by volunteers. Donated funds go toward
helping individuals pay for the cost of the abortion, excepting small
amounts for operatings expenses and part-time support staff. Your
donation helps a Wyoming resident in a very stressful situation access
critical reproductive health care and decision-making control over
their own body. Please help us provide access to healthcare and
reproductive justice in Wyoming!
