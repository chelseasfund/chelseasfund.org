Women for Women is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established in
1998 by Wyoming women determined to make sure that despite Wyoming's
remoteness and limited abortion services, Wyoming women can make and
implement the critical personal decision whether to terminate a
pregnancy. Wyoming women must travel either out of state or to the far
western corner of Wyoming (Jackson) to access an abortion provider. As
a result, they often incur substantial travel expenses and expenses
associated with time away from work and other responsibilities, in
addition to the cost of the procedure which typically varies from $445
to $1300. Many women -- the hard-working single mom, the college
student with two jobs, the recently laid-off mother, the teenager, the
woman whose doctor told her she was physically incapable of becoming
pregnant, to name just a few examples -- simply cannot come up with
those funds in the short time before the procedure. We know there are
many reasons a woman terminates a pregnancy. **WE TRUST WOMEN** to be
the best able to make that decision for themselves. One out of four
women in the United States has an abortion [by the age of
45](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states). This
means that despite what you may think, having an abortion is something
many women decide is necessary and, in fact, critical to their lives.

## Mission

We firmly believe that a woman's ability to make and implement these
critical decisions about her own body, her own life, and her physical,
emotional and financial health should not depend on whether she has
the financial resources to instantly pay this unexpected and
significant expense. Having sufficient funds should not be the
determining factor whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Women for
Women is here to help bring reproductive justice to the women of
Wyoming and make sure that children are wanted, intentional, and not a
result of lacking sufficient money.

## Donations

Women for Women is all-volunteer. That means all donated funds,
excepting negligible amounts for stamps, PO Box fees, etc., go
entirely to helping women pay for the cost of the
abortion. Consequently, any donation you make directly helps a Wyoming
woman in a very stressful situation access critical reproductive
health care and decision-making control over her own body. Please help
us provide reproductive justice to Wyoming women!
