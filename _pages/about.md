Chelsea's Fund was established in 1998 and has been supporting Wyoming
women ever since. [Prior to 2019](/newname/), we were known as Women
for Women.

## Overview

[Chelsea's Fund](/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
established to ensure Wyoming people can make and implement the
critical personal decision whether to terminate a pregnancy. Currently, 
Wyoming residents must travel out of state or to the far western corner 
of Wyoming to access an abortion provider. Consequently, in addition to
the procedureâ€™s cost, they often incur substantial expenses for travel
and time away from responsibilities. Many cannot come up with those
funds in the short time before the procedure. One in four women in the
US has an abortion [by the age of
45](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states).
Having an abortion is something many people decide is necessary and
critical to their lives. Pregnant people are the best at making
that decision for themselves.

## Mission

We firmly believe that a person's ability to make and implement these
critical decisions about her own body, her own life, and her physical,
emotional and financial health should not depend on whether she has
the financial resources to instantly pay this unexpected and
significant expense. Having sufficient funds should not be the
determining factor whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Women for
Women is here to help bring reproductive justice to Wyoming people and to 
make sure that children are wanted, intentional, and not a
result of lacking sufficient money.

## Donations

Chelsea's Fund is all-volunteer. That means all donated funds,
excepting negligible amounts for stamps, PO Box fees, etc., go
entirely to helping women pay for the cost of the
abortion. Consequently, any donation you make directly helps a Wyoming
woman in a very stressful situation access critical reproductive
health care and decision-making control over her own body. Please help
us provide reproductive justice to Wyoming!
