**Abortion remains legal and available in Wyoming at this time.**
  Our ongoing [litigation](/litigation) has resulted in all current
  Wyoming abortion bans being stayed while the litigtion proceeds.
  JustThePill (telehealth), Women's Health and Family Care
  (Jackson, WY), and Wellspring Health Access (Casper, WY) are
  continuing to provide abortion services in Wyoming.
  **See our [providers](/providers) page for additional
  details on available options.**

**Do you need assistance to access abortion services?** Chelseaâ€™s Fund
provides information about [abortion providers](/providers) relevant
to Wyoming residents and offers [financial assistance](/financial) if
you are unable to afford an abortion. Reproductive justice demands
that reproductive health care and the right to self-determination be
available to all, not just those with financial resources.

If you have any questions, are ready to ask for assistance (ideally,
review the page on [financial assistance](/financial) first), or feel
you just need to speak to someone directly, **call or text us at
{{site.author.phone }}**. If we don't answer, please leave a
message. We will get back to you within 1 business day.

Worried you may become pregnant? **[Plan
B](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-plan-b-morning-after-pill)**
(**emergency contraception**, also know as "the morning after pill") is
legal in Wyoming. It is available over-the-counter and no prescription
is required. You can find Plan B at local pharmacies or for free via
[Wellspring Health Access](https://wellspringaccess.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
