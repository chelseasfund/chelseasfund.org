**Update (3/18/23):** Governor Gordon today allowed a new abortion ban
  to become law. Pending the outcome of an [upcoming Temporary
  Restraining Order hearing](/litigation), abortion is now illegal in
  Wyoming. **Please contact [providers](/providers) in Colorado,
  Montana, or Utah to access abortion care. We can
  [assist](/financial) you in getting care in those states.** Governor
  Gordon also signed into law a ban on medication abortion which goes
  into effect on July 1, 2023.

**Do you need assistance to access abortion services?** Chelseaâ€™s Fund
provides information about [abortion providers](/providers) relevant
to Wyoming residents and offers [financial assistance](/financial) if
you are unable to afford an abortion. Reproductive justice demands
that reproductive health care and the right to self-determination be
available to all, not just those with financial resources.

If you have any questions, are ready to ask for assistance (ideally,
review the page on [financial assistance](/financial) first), or feel
you just need to speak to someone directly, **call us at
{{site.author.phone }}**. If we don't answer, please leave a
message. We will get back to you within 1 business day.

Worried you may become pregnant? **[Plan
B](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-plan-b-morning-after-pill)**
(**emergency contraception**, also know as "the morning after pill") is
legal in Wyoming. It is available over-the-counter and no prescription
is required. You can find Plan B at local pharmacies or for free via
[Wellspring Health Access](https://wellspringaccess.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
