**Abortion remains legal in Wyoming at this time. See our [litigation
  page](/litigation) for more information.**

**Do you need assistance to access abortion services?** Chelseaâ€™s Fund
provides information about [abortion providers](/providers) relevant
to Wyoming residents and offers [financial assistance](/financial) if
you are unable to afford an abortion. Reproductive justice demands
that reproductive health care and the right to self-determination be
available to all, not just those with financial resources.

If you have any questions, are ready to ask for assistance (ideally,
review the page on [financial assistance](/financial) first), or feel
you just need to speak to someone directly, **call us at
{{site.author.phone }}**. If we don't answer, please leave a
message. We will get back to you within 1 business day.

Worried you may become pregnant? [Plan

legal in Wyoming. It is available over-the-counter and no prescription
is required. You can find Plan B at local pharmacies or for free via
