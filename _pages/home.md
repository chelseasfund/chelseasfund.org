Chelsea's Fund ([formerly known as Women for Women](/newname))
provides information about [abortion providers](/providers) relevant
to Wyoming residents. We also offer [financial assistance](/financial)
to those who would otherwise not be able to afford an
abortion. Reproductive justice demands that reproductive
health care and the right to self-determination be available to all,
not just those with financial resources.

If you have any questions, are ready to ask for assistance (ideally,
review the page on [financial assistance](/financial) first), or feel
you just need to speak to someone directly, **call us at
{{site.author.phone }}**. If we don't answer, please leave a
message. We will get back to you within 1 business day.

**We recently put up billboards supporting the right to choose in
Lander and Riverton, WY. See [pictures and details here](/billboard).**
