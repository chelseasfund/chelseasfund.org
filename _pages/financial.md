If you are a Wyoming or eastern Idaho resident and are unable to afford an abortion,
[Women for Women](/) is here to help you. If you reside elsewhere,
please contact the [National Network of Abortion
Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/) for funding suggestions.

We are happy to speak with you anytime to provide information about
available abortion services, providers, and funding
options. Sometimes it is useful to speak with us prior to getting an
appointment since we are familiar with [relevant provider
options](/providers). However, for us to commit to funding you, you will first need
to take the following steps:

1. **Determine** if you are pregnant.
2. **Call [a clinic](/providers)** that provides abortion services and
discuss the option that best suits your needs.
3. **Make an appointment** for your procedure and determine the
cost. Discuss your financial situation with the clinic, and ask them
whether they have any means to reduce the price or know of other
sources of support. _(Some clinics have their own funds to help reduce
costs.)_
4. **Call Women for Women at {{ site.author.phone }}**.

**When you call**, one of our volunteers will ask you a few questions,
which may include questions about your income, family support,
children, and extenuating circumstances. We will also need to know:

* Which clinic you are planning to use.
* When your appointment is scheduled.
* What the remaining cost of your abortion is.

_Please note that our resources are limited, and our mission is to
provide funding to those who would not otherwise be able to pay for an
abortion. Prior to calling, please consider how much you will be able 
to contribute and what other funding resources are available. If we 
are able to help you, it will likely only be for a portion of the full 
amount. We will do our best to help you so that you are able to follow 
through with your decision. _

**If we do not answer, please leave a message** with your name and
number and the date and time of your appointment. Please be aware that
we do not have an office; we are an organization of women with other
jobs who do our best to return your call as soon as we can. We will
return your call within one business day, and often within a matter of
hours.

**If you do not reach us immediately, use the time to call the
[Wyoming Abortion
Fund](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-rocky-mountains/patient-resources/wyoming-abortion-fund)
at 866-372-7526.** The Wyoming Abortion Fund is a separate fund
managed by Planned Parenthood. It is specifically intended to help 
Wyoming residents afford an abortion. You are welcome to call them 
before or after calling us.  It is not unusual for a woman
to receive funding from both funds, as needed.

**When we provide assistance** we notify the clinic and pay them
directly on your behalf.
